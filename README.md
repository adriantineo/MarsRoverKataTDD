A small exercise in python to experiment with Test-Driven Development (TDD)
as a development technique. Inspired by the experiment at:
https://blog.deltaforce.io/wordpress/running-a-coding-dojo-to-improve-python-tdd-skills/

This was prepared to be presented as introduction to TDD at the
Bern Software Developers Meetup on 21st May 2015.

Thank you to all the participants for their interesting remarks
and for sharing their experience.

You can access right here the audio (tdd_zen_of_programming_talk.mp3)
and the slides (tdd_zen_of_programming_slides.pdf)
from the presentation and discussion part of the session.
